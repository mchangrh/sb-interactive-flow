        <p>
        Typically found at the start of a video. Segments where an animation, still frame or clip which is repeated in other videos by the same creator is used. In live streams this can be used to skip past technical issues if no content is present. If the segment starts at the very beginning, please make sure the start time is exactly 0 seconds.
        <br>
        This does not include spoken introductions, unless that spoken introduction is identical to ones seen in other videos by the same creator (Ex: Daily Dose of Internet). A greeting containing speech may be marked as intro if and only if it is separated from the rest of the video with a clear visual AND audio cut.
        <br>
        Do not submit skits, time-lapses, slomo, disclaimers to protect viewers, preparation, and cleanup clips. Also, do not use this to skip past content to get to the main point of the video.
