        <h1>Unpaid/ Self Promotion</h1>
        <p>
          Unpaid: the creator will not receive any kind of payment in return for this promotion. (Charity drive, free shout out, shout out to someone who helped them previously)
          <br>
          Self Promo: promoting a product or service that is directly related to the Youtube creator themselves. They can also be promoting things such as a discord server, blog, mailing list, social media, television appearance, or fan meet-up.
          <br>
          If the segment switches between interaction reminder and unpaid/self promo rapidly, include them in this segment. If an outro is also included, use outro.
