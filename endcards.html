          <h1>Endcards/Credits (Outro)</h1>
          <p>
            Typically near or at the end of the video when the credits pop up and/or endcards show.
            <br>
            If the creator quickly switches between interaction and self promo during during an outro and separating them would make too many or too small segments, then you can bundle them into this segment.
            <br>
            If the segment reaches the very end, make sure the end time matches the exact end time of the video (use 'end' button in the popup). If something included in the endcard segment can cleanly be left out, leave it out and mark it another category
