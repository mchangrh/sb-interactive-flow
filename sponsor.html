        <h1>Sponsor</h1>
        <p>
          Part of a video which is promoting a product or service not related to the Youtube creator. The creator will receive payment for a sponsorship in the form of money or free products.
          <br>
          If the video is entirely about the product or service, leave the initial sponsor disclosure alone. This makes the viewer aware of any potential bias. Do not submit on-screen only sponsors that play during content.
