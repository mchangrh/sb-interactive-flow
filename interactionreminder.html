      <p>
        When a creator is asking you to like, subscribe, turn on notifications, comment, or share the video. This may also include them telling you to click on another one of their videos.
        <br>
        This does not include on-screen animations or graphics of like, subscribe, and notification buttons which play during content. If you can remove one of these without cutting content or making a bad transition, go ahead. If bundled together with an outro or self promo and separating them makes a bad cut or is too short, submit it along with that segment.
