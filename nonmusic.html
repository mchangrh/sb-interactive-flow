      <h1>Music: Nonmusic Section</h1>
      <p>
        Only to be used on videos which feature music as the primary content. Segments should mark sections of the video that are not present in official music releases (Spotify).
        <br>
        Non-Music exists independently of other categories, so it is okay to overlap it with them.
        </br>
        Do not mark sections which have the music playing in the background. For segments at the end of the music, only start the cut once the music has gone completely silent. Boost your audio as much as you can to avoid prematurely clipping the end.
